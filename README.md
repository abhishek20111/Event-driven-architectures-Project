# Event-Driven Scalable Data Processing System

## Introduction
This project implements a scalable and resilient **event-driven system** for processing high-throughput real-time data streams using **RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Redis, GraphQL, Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana**. It features **four producers and four consumers**, ensuring fault tolerance, monitoring, and caching to enhance performance and reliability. The system is designed for high efficiency, leveraging **Redis caching** to store frequently accessed data and reduce database queries. Additionally, **GraphQL optimizes** data fetching, ensuring **minimal latency and improved performance**. The system is **fully containerized** with Docker, making it ready for Kubernetes (K8s) integration in the future.

### Key Requirements & How Our System Fulfills Them:

1. **Scalable Event Ingestion Pipeline**
   ![RabbitMQ](https://img.shields.io/badge/RabbitMQ-FF6600?style=for-the-badge&logo=rabbitmq&logoColor=white)
   - We use **RabbitMQ** ([Official Docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials)) as a message broker to efficiently ingest data from **four different producers**.
   - Each producer sends data to RabbitMQ, which distributes messages to available consumers.
   - **Scalability:** RabbitMQ queues and load balancing ensure smooth data ingestion under high traffic.

3. **Reliable Event Processing with Error Handling**
   ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-47A248?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
   - Consumers process messages and store them in **MongoDB**.
   - **Fault Tolerance:** If a consumer fails, messages are re-queued using:
     ```js
     channel.nack(msg, false, true);
     ```
     This ensures that messages are not lost and are retried in case of failure.
   - **Acknowledgment:** Once successfully processed, messages are acknowledged:
     ```js
     channel.ack(msg);
     ```

5. **Queryable API for Processed Data**
   ![GraphQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/GraphQL-E10098?style=for-the-badge&logo=graphql&logoColor=white)
   - Implemented a **GraphQL API** ([Official Docs](https://graphql.org/faq/getting-started)) for optimized querying.
   - Redis caching is used to **speed up API calls** and reduce load on MongoDB.

7. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - ![Grafana](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grafana-F46800?style=for-the-badge&logo=grafana&logoColor=white) **Grafana** ([Docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started)): Visual dashboards for system metrics.  
   - ![Prometheus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prometheus-E6522C?style=for-the-badge&logo=prometheus&logoColor=white) **Prometheus** ([Docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/)): Captures real-time performance data.  
   - ![Loki](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loki-00ADD8?style=for-the-badge&logo=grafana&logoColor=white) **Loki** ([Docs](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/quick-start/)): Log aggregation and debugging.  
   - API endpoint to expose metrics:
     ```js
     app.get('/metrics', async (req, res) => {
         res.setHeader('Content-Type', client.register.contentType);
         const metrics = await client.register.metrics();
         res.send(metrics);
     });
     ```
     ```js
     // Create logger for the application
      const options = {
          
          transports: [
            new LokiTransport({
              host: "http://127.0.0.1:3100"
            })
          ]   
        }; 
      const logger = createLogger(options);
      ```

9. **System Resilience and Kubernetes Readiness**
   ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
   ![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-326CE5?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)
   - **Containerization:** Dockerized services for easy deployment and scaling.
   - **Future K8s Integration:** The system can be deployed on Kubernetes ([Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)) to scale dynamically with multiple pods.
